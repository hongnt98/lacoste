            <li>2. As we work with different Frames, it is possible that you will not be able to recognise the encryption directly or that your browser will not always inform you with a message showing the link with an SSL server. However, you can see the protected transmission of your data (https mode) when, in the checkout section, you press the right-hand button of the mouse and select the function, "Display the source text".</li>
            <li>3. We save all personal information solely on a computer that is not connected to the Internet. Access by other people using the network of a modem is not, therefore, possible.</li>
